<h1>Fungi Location Based Pokemons Trading iOS App</h1>

<h2>About The Project</h2>
<p>Fungi was my first application on iOS, I decided to start it as a side project to help Pokemon Go users to find each others
and trade pokemons, but I did not release the application because the company did not release the trading feature in that time, but I had very good experience working on the app.
